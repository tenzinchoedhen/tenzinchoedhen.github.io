            <h2>From Code to Insights: My Journey into Business Analytics</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div><br>
            <span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">
              <p>
                If someone told me a few years ago that I'd be knee-deep in data analytics, working towards 
                getting a Master's degree in Business Analytics, I probably would have laughed and gone back 
                to debugging code. But here we are.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before diving into the details of my journey, let me set the stage with a little industry 
                context—because believe it or not, tariffs can be the villain in this story. In the Japanese 
                automobile manufacturing industry, every single part—from the smallest bolt to entire truck 
                engines—needs a Certificate of Origin (COO) to prove it’s made in Japan. If these certificates 
                aren’t handled properly, companies face heavy tariffs when exporting. Imagine building a flawless 
                truck, only to have unnecessary costs piled on because someone mishandled paperwork. Not exactly 
                the efficiency dream of a manufacturing giant.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I joined Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation’s Digital Transformation Office, I 
                quickly realized that the process of managing these COOs was a mess of manual work, endless 
                emails, and human error. It was like watching someone try to untangle a pair of wired 
                earphones—frustrating and time-consuming.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s where I stepped in.
              </p>

                The COO Automation Project: Turning Tangled Processes into Streamlined Solutions
              </p>
              <p>
                My background in software development meant I was used to breaking down complex problems and 
                building solutions from the ground up. But applying that mindset in a business setting—where 
                the stakes weren’t just crashing apps but real financial consequences—was both thrilling and 
                challenging.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project that really defined my time at Mitsubishi Fuso was automating the Certificate of Origin 
                process. Using Microsoft's Power Automate workflows, I created an automated system that streamlined communication 
                with suppliers and eliminated the need for tedious manual input. This wasn’t just a "nice to have" 
                feature—it was transformative. The new system reduced 640 manual work hours annually and saved the 
                company a whopping 3.2 million JPY every year. But beyond the numbers, it fundamentally reshaped how 
                the company approached certificate delivery to end customers, reducing the risk of costly tariffs and 
                ensuring smoother operations.

                From Software Developer to Business Analyst: Lessons Learned
              </p>
              <p>
                What stood out to me most during this project was how transferable my software development skills 
                were to business analytics. Debugging code isn’t all that different from debugging a business 
                process—both require a sharp eye for inefficiencies and a methodical approach to problem-solving. 
                The key difference? The "bugs" in business processes often have a much bigger ripple effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned to see data not just as numbers or lines of code, but as powerful tools for storytelling 
                and decision-making. Each automated workflow wasn’t just a piece of tech—it was a solution that 
                directly impacted people’s daily work and the company’s bottom line. That’s when I realized I wanted 
                to dive deeper into business intelligence, using data-driven insights to identify opportunities for 
                digital transformation.
              </p>

                Looking Ahead
              </p>
              <p>
                My time at Mitsubishi Fuso solidified my passion for combining technology and analytics to drive 
                meaningful change. Now, as a graduate student in business analytics, I’m eager to build on this 
                foundation and continue finding ways to automate processes, reduce costs, and help businesses 
                make smarter decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because at the end of the day, whether it's untangling code or business processes, there's nothing 
                more satisfying than finding a solution that just… works!
              </p>

                few lessons learned along the way.
